# hello-in-hand手语“你好”翻译模型
机器学习课设做着玩的，第一次用github上传得不好请见谅  model为已经训练好的模型，检测方式是运行detect.py文件  引用请标注地址或者给个星星谢谢

This is a machine learning course project that I did for fun. It's my first time uploading to GitHub, so please forgive any imperfections.  
The model is already trained. To perform detection, simply run the detect.py file.
